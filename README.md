# ImageLoading

This is Image Loading app to loading images by Picasso and Glide libraries

I use in this project:

1 - Using **Picasso** library for loading images into imageview from (drawable - url - use callbacks - resize image - rotate image).

2 - Using **Glide** library for loading images and gif into imageview from (drawable - url).

3 - Using Imageview and buttons.

4 - Using intent for moving between intents.
